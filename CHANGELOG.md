## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- MoE expert-selective streaming for `qwen3moe` (Qwen3-30B-A3B and siblings), `qwen2moe`,
  and `llada-moe`: stream only the routed experts per token from flash, with an optional
  LRU cache and a parallel read pool. Lossless — byte-identical to a full in-memory run,
  proven by the synthetic gates and confirmed on a real 64-expert 4 GiB model on the
  desktop host.
- Zero-fork llama.cpp integration: expert streaming is driven entirely through the public
  eval-callback and gguf accessors; `third_party/llama.cpp` is a stock upstream submodule.
- `bmoe-cli` host tool with machine telemetry (`--progress`) and a CSV sink.
- Byte-identity gates (`bmoe_moe_gates`) with a tiny synthetic model generator
  (`scripts/make-tiny-moe.py`).
- Android example app (`examples/android`): minimal chat with a live telemetry panel,
  packaged as a debug APK built and published as a CI artifact.
- Documentation: architecture, the seam, MoE streaming, adding a model, telemetry,
  benchmark method, limitations, roadmap.
