// What a device COSTS to use, measured by using it.
//
// Two facts live here, and they have nothing in common except that both are usually taken from a
// declaration and both have been wrong when taken that way.
//
// **Is this device's memory the host's?** The device type is not the answer. `TYPE_IGPU` is a claim
// of shared memory, believed because believing it errs safe; `TYPE_GPU` is not the opposite claim —
// Metal reports it on unified-memory hardware. Reading it as "has its own memory" is how one
// physical pool gets counted twice, which is the accounting that told a capacity fitter an
// integrated GPU had 15195 MiB free on a machine holding 11 GB, and took the machine down. So it is
// settled from the native memory topology where available, otherwise by allocating on the device
// and watching what the host loses. A shared topology is not contradicted by a flat allocation delta.
//
// **What does one host/device boundary crossing cost?** This is the term a bandwidth ratio cannot
// see and the one that decides an offload in practice: dense and expert halves alternate per layer,
// so a split placement crosses twice per layer. A device measured at 20 GiB/s against a host's 12
// still ran the move at 0.53x. Measured here the way the graph crosses at a layer boundary: one
// token's hidden state copied to the device, one op launched on it there, and copied back.
//
// Both are best-effort and both fail closed: where the measurement cannot be made the fact stays
// Unknown or zero, and every rule above declines rather than assuming. Nothing here writes a
// constant into the plan — what is in this file is HOW to ask, never the answer.
//
// Bounded by construction: tensors sized by the model rather than by a guess, samples sized by
// duration rather than by a repetition count, everything released on every path.

// into the device, the device's work on it launched, and the result copied back, each leg waited
// for. The op is trivial on purpose - what is priced is the CROSSING, so the arithmetic on the far
// side must not show up in it - and it is real, because a crossing is a split the device has to be
// told to run. Half the round trip is one crossing.
//
// This replaces a measurement that differenced a chain of ops run all on the host against the same
// chain alternating between host and device, through the scheduler. It read zero on a discrete card
// whose backend runs asynchronously: the mixed arm came out no slower than the host arm, so a
// crossing that costs tens of microseconds went unpriced and the plan said so on every run. Timing
// the copies themselves, with every leg synchronized, cannot read zero on a device that is there.
