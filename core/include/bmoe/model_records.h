// What a model measured about itself on this machine, kept between loads: its recorded routing, which
// the planner prices the cache on (bmoe/routing.h, AutoPlanOptions::routing), and the verdicts of the
// decisions --auto measures (bmoe/measured_knobs.h). Every front-end keeps them the same way, so an
// --auto plan is the same whichever one runs it, and a calibration one of them ran is the others' too.
// Where the folder is is the front-end's decision (bmoe-cli and bmoe-server default to the per-user data
// folder); inside it, one file per model named by the model file's content fingerprint
// (model_fingerprint in bmoe/probe.h): a file copied or renamed finds its record, another model never
// does. The fingerprint is a few MiB of
// reads, so it is computed once per file and remembered by path, size and modification time, the key
// the model library already uses for what it reads from a file.
