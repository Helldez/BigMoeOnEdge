// What this gguf is, and what it demands per token, as facts a planning rule may read.
//
// The companion to HardwareProfile: between them they are the planner's whole input. Everything
// here is discovered from the file's own metadata and tensor shapes — no architecture name decides
// anything, no size threshold is written down, and a model family the engine has never seen
// produces a profile like any other. Where a field cannot be discovered it stays 0, and the rules
// that need it decline.
//
// The model asks for wildly different things from different parts of itself, which is the entire
// reason a single global policy leaves throughput on the table: a 30B MoE reads every byte of its
// attention weights per token and roughly one row of its embedding table, and pricing both as
// "dense weights" prices things that differ by three orders of magnitude identically. So the file
// is decomposed into groups by ACCESS SHAPE, and each carries its own per-token demand.
//
// On not hardcoding: which tensors are EXPERT weights is read from the file's shapes
// (bmoe/expert_layout.h), so a new MoE family needs nothing here. The remaining names —
// `token_embd`, `output`, `blk.N.attn_*`, `blk.N.ffn_*` — are the gguf naming convention itself,
// which every architecture llama.cpp converts shares; they are a property of the FORMAT, not of
// any model, and a name that matches nothing lands in Other and is priced as read-whole, which is
// the conservative direction: an unrecognised tensor can make a plan cautious, never reckless.
//
// Pure policy: no llama.cpp, no I/O. See core/src/plan/model_probe.cpp for the adapter that fills
// this from a gguf, and bmoe/planner.h for what reads it.
