// Nothing is generated. The answer is the next-token distribution after the prompt, so a decision
// costs its prefill and no decode — on this engine, where decode streams experts from flash token
// by token, that is the difference between seconds and minutes for a large model. The shape fits
// any caller that picks from a list: an agent choosing the next UI action from lettered
// candidates, a router, a multiple-choice benchmark. See docs/decide.md.
