// Per-step, per-layer MoE routing trace: the analysis instrument behind --route-trace.
//
// The per-token metrics (metrics.h) say how long a token took and how many expert bytes it
// pulled. They cannot say WHICH experts each layer routed, how strongly the router weighted
// them, or whether a routed expert was already resident — and that is what decides the
// streaming cost. This port exposes exactly that: one row per (step, layer, slot), i.e. the
// cells of a step x layer matrix whose payload is the routed expert ids.
//
// It is a diagnostic, not a product feature. Capturing it asks the compute graph for extra
// nodes (one more barrier per MoE layer) and writes a row per routed expert, so a traced run
// is not a benchmark run. See docs/telemetry.md.
