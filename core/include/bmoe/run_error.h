// Why a request to the engine failed, as a kind a caller can act on.
//
// A failure's `error` string is prose for a person and free to change; every decision a front-end
// makes about a failure (keep the session or close it, offer a new chat, retry) reads the kind.
// The name of each kind is the stable spelling the CLI's line protocol and the server's API carry
// as `code` (docs/telemetry.md, docs/server-api.md).
//
// Pure policy header (no llama.cpp types).
